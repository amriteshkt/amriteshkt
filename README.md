### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amritesh.

I'm a Python developer and Data Scientist with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. I work extensively with:

- **Data Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **SQL** for data manipulation and querying
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`

Currently diving deep into **Deep Learning** using `PyTorch`!
